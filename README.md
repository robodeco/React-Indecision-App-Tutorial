# React-Indecision-App-Tutorial

I did not conceptualize and hard-code this application on my own. This is from a course instructed by Andrew Mead over Udemy which went through the basics of React as well as some advanced techniques and applications. To find the tutorial please visit this link: https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview

This application utilizes React, Webpack, SASS, and the package installers npm/yarn. The application itself is a simple CRUD-esque program that allows the user to add tasks they need to complete, have the computer pick a task to complete for them, then delete said task when it is done.
